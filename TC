Given an array A[] and a number x, check for a pair in A[] with the sum as x, where N is:

1) 1 <= N <= 10^3
2) 1 <= N <= 10^5
3) 1 <= N <= 10^8
For Case 1: A naive solution that is using two for-loops works as it gives us a complexity of O(N2), 
which even in the worst case will perform 106 operations which are well under 108. Of course, O(N)
and O(NlogN) is also acceptable in this case.
consider largest n value and substitute in time complexity and ch3ck if it is less than 10 power 8
